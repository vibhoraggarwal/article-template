Mr. Robot is an American drama thriller television series created by Sam Esmail for USA Network. It stars Rami Malek as Elliot Alderson, a cybersecurity engineer and hacker with social anxiety disorder and clinical depression. Elliot is recruited by an insurrectionary anarchist known as "Mr. Robot", played by Christian Slater, to join a group of hacktivists called "fsociety".[8] The group aims to destroy all debt records by encrypting the financial data of E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world.

The pilot premiered via online and video on demand services on May 27, 2015. The first season debuted on USA Network on June 24, 2015, and the second on July 13, 2016.

The fourth and final season premiered on October 6, 2019, and will consist of 13 episodes.[9]

Mr. Robot has received critical acclaim: it won the Golden Globe for Best Television Drama Series; it was recognized with a Peabody Award; and in 2016, the series received six Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series with Malek winning for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series
